## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

I wanted to make as little amount of changes as possible while meeting the criteria in order to keep everything consolidated. It was and interesting process manipulating other code so i wanted to explore how it goes.

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Credits](#credits)
- [License](#license)

## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

   C:\Users\bburr\Challenge-5\Assets\screencapture-file-C-Users-bburr-Challenge-5-index-html-2023-07-11-18_06_05.png

## Credits
i was pretty much on my own for this .

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

An active model of what you have going for the day and color coded so you can see what timeblocks still remain


## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.
